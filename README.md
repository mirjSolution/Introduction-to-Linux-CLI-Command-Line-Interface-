# 💻 Introduction to Linux CLI (Command Line Interface)

This guide introduces the basics of using the **Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)** — how it compares to a graphical interface (GUI), how to interpret the terminal prompt, and why CLI is a critical skill for DevOps professionals.

## 🧠 GUI vs CLI: What’s the Difference?

| Interface                          | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) | A visual environment to interact with the system using windows, icons, and menus. Ideal for beginners.                                                |
| **CLI** (Command Line Interface)   | A text-based interface where users type commands to manage files, applications, and system settings. Preferred in server and automation environments. |

> DevOps engineers mostly work in **CLI environments**, especially when connecting to remote servers.

## 🖥️ What is a Terminal?

A **terminal** is the application that gives you access to the CLI.

- Think of it like a chat window between you and your system.
- You can open multiple terminal **windows** or **tabs** just like browser windows.
- Inside the terminal, you type commands and the OS executes them.

## 📌 Terminal Prompt Breakdown

Example:

```bash
rico-john-dato-on@devops:~$
```

| Part                | Description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rico-john-dato-on` | Username of the current user                            |
| `@devops`           | Hostname (name of the machine/server)                   |
| `~`                 | Home directory of the user                              |
| `$`                 | Indicates a regular user (not root). Root users see `#` |

---

## 🔐 Regular vs Root User

- `$` → Regular user
- `#` → Root user (has full control of the system)

> **Root access** allows unrestricted changes to the system — use it only when absolutely necessary.

## 🚀 Why CLI is Essential for DevOps

- **Most servers do not have a GUI**
- CLI is more **efficient** and **scriptable**
- Enables **automation** through scripts and tools
- Essential for working with DevOps tools like:
  - `Git`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Jenkins`, `Terraform`, and more

> Once you build confidence with the CLI, you’ll often prefer it over the GUI for speed and control.

---

## 📝 Summary

- **GUI** = Easy, visual interface
- **CLI** = Powerful, text-based, and essential for DevOps
- The terminal prompt tells you **who you are**, **where you are**, and your **privilege level**
- Learning CLI is a **must** for any DevOps engineer, sysadmin, or cloud professional
